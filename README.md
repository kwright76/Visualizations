# Self-Study Project
Kyle Wright 
## Evaluation Framework: 
Each criteria can be scored on a scale of 1 to 5. 1 being the inability to meet the criteria and 5 being perfectly met.
1. Performance Expectancy - Does the visualization portray the information correctly and concisely?
2. Effort Expectancy - Is the visualization easy to use and understand?
3. Social Influence - Does the visualization enhance one's vision or status?

## Visualizations

**1. Temperature change from green house gases (GHG), human forces (ANT), mostly aerosols from humans (OA), natural forces (NAT), and variability in natural forces.**

The box and whisker plot shows how devastating humans have been on the environment, but the tru beauty in the plot is in the simplicity. The importance is to understand the abbreviations and there seems to be enough space in the plot to get rid of the abbreviations. This wouls allow for it to be able to be shown on its own without any explanation. It can be concluded from this plot that green house gases are the number one contributor to temperature rise, although the plot shows that this statistic is also the most variant based on the whiskers. Meaning that there could be more or less impact from green house gases, but the data is unable to make a conclusion.

**2. Change in CO2 (Evidence of burning of fossil fuels) and O2 ratio in the atmosphere and CO2 from natural resources**

The graph is very eye catching due to its extreme angles of change. Although it is difficult to understand it without some preknown knowledge such as the abbreviations, it is clear the graph is showing the correlation between rising CO2 gases and oxygen. One thing this graph is missing is the time analysis as it can be misinterpreted due to unmarked vertical lines. As far as colors go, it is clear that the blue shows a cooling ability and green refers to greenhouse gases or the human element, but the bottom graph can be deceiving based on the same green color being thought to be human interaction rather than natural.

**3. Earth's historical levels of CO2 in the atmoshpere.**

This line graph matches all criteria to be an informational factoid. It shows a large history of data concisely with a heavy ability to instill the fact clearly. The graph is very easy to read and understand due to simple axis labels and data driven information at critical points. The dashed line showing the maximum level of CO2 until post Industrial Revolution shows the author's vision and what he wanted the reader to gain from the visualization. The one drawback would be the background as it is ver comlex and is in all unnecessary. 

**4. C02 compared to Antarctic tempertures (History of Ice Ages)**

Against climate change caused by humans.

The line graph is made to show that the CO2 levels are equivelant to past rise and fall in temperature which aligns with Antarctic temperatures, so it is showing what the author wants it to show. But, the blue CO2 line is deceiving due to the dotted line on the far right of the graph. Due to the small size of the graph it is not obvious that this is the same graph as visualization number 3 in this list creating a misperception of the data. Also, their is not a scale to measure the levels of CO2 leading to further questioning validation. The ethics of this visualization are very questionable.

We will have no class sessions in the second week of the quarter. Instead, you will spend this week exploring
the heterogeneous world of data visualization. The topic for the self-study project is climate change caused
by human activity.
Your objective is twofold:
1. Collect 5 distinctly different visualizations of climate change (At least one visualization should argue
AGAINST that climate change is caused by human activity). Review, compare and contrast the
five visualizations. To do so, first, develop a literature-based evaluation framework and then use the
framework to evaluate your five visualizations. Second, write an overall assessment and conclusion.
2. Replicate the following visualization of climate change to the best of your abilities: Warming stripes.
The data is linked in the article. This visualization must not be part of the five visualizations that
you collected above.
Your submission consists of a GitHub project that contains all material (visualizations, text, etc.). Make
sure that you use appropriate means for referencing material that you have used for your project (See the
academic integrity policies below).
