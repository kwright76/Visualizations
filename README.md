# Self-Study Project
Self-Study Project
We will have no class sessions in the second week of the quarter. Instead, you will spend this week exploring
the heterogeneous world of data visualization. The topic for the self-study project is climate change caused
by human activity.
Your objective is twofold:
1. Collect 5 distinctly different visualizations of climate change (At least one visualization should argue
AGAINST that climate change is caused by human activity). Review, compare and contrast the
five visualizations. To do so, first, develop a literature-based evaluation framework and then use the
framework to evaluate your five visualizations. Second, write an overall assessment and conclusion.
2. Replicate the following visualization of climate change to the best of your abilities: Warming stripes.
The data is linked in the article. This visualization must not be part of the five visualizations that
you collected above.
Your submission consists of a GitHub project that contains all material (visualizations, text, etc.). Make
sure that you use appropriate means for referencing material that you have used for your project (See the
academic integrity policies below).

#Evaluation Framework: 
Each criteria can be scored on a scale of 1 to 5. 1 being the inability to meet the criteria and 5 being perfectly met.
1. Performance Expectancy - Does the visualization portray the information correctly and concisely?
2. Effort Expectancy - Is the visualization easy to use and understand?
3. Social Influence - Does the visualization enhance one's vision or status?
