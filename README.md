# Individual Project
## Data Exploration
Kyle Wright 

**Questions to ask**
•	What could be the core message of the data?
•	What are the important descriptors of the data?
•	What are the important changes over time?
•	Who could be interested in the data? 
On top of the above questions, I also considered the below questions in my visualizations. 
•	How can the data be visualized so there could be an immediate understanding of the complexity of the data in a simple way?
•	When did the most drastic change occur?
•	What are the different levels that the data can be seen at?
•	How can more data fit in the visualization to prove my point without being distracting?
