## Aspect #1

When compared to red light camera violations, there are points in the data that seem to have the same trend. Showing a possible reason or explanation outside of the public's control. On the other hand, the similarities show that speeding is directly associated with running red lights. 

### The Making Of Aspect One
I came up with this visualization by taking into account what Professor Schermann said about using other data to point out key insights in the data. What I found was a similar data source that had redlight camera information in the city of Chicago. From there I was not interested in what the redlight data told me about redlights, rather I was interrested in how the redlight data could magnify or attribute my speed camera data. By having the ability to point out monthly trends in the data I compared them together to show a correlation between speeding cars that also run red lights.

### Roadmap Of Aspect One
Include a coorelation aspect to show the similarity.
