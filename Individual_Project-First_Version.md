## Aspect #1

When compared to red light camera violations, there are points in the data that seem to have the same trend. Showing a possible reason or explanation outside of the public's control. On the other hand, the similarities show that speeding is directly associated with running red lights. 

### The Making Of Aspect One
I came up with this visualization by taking into account what Professor Schermann said about using other data to point out key insights in the data. What I found was a similar data source that had redlight camera information in the city of Chicago. From there I was not interested in what the redlight data told me about redlights, rather I was interrested in how the redlight data could magnify or attribute my speed camera data. By having the ability to point out monthly trends in the data I compared them together to show a correlation between speeding cars that also run red lights.

### Roadmap Of Aspect One
Include a corelation aspect to show the similarity.

## Aspect #2

It is important to see the difference in areas of the city where there are more violations. Tracking down the violations per neighborhood could allow safer streets for other drivers and pedestrians.

### The Making Of Aspect Two
With the updated data, included was the neighborhoods of the city so I thought this was a very important point to bring attention to.

### Roadmap Of Aspect One
Include names of the wards to the data. Find some crime rate information to compare crime and in the neighborhoods of Chicago and speeders in the city.

## Aspect #3

With safety in the city being a primary factor, safety in broader areas of the city and the immensely distinct contrasts of the hemispheres shows the west is more dangerous than the other 3 areas.

### The Making Of Aspect Three
The discovery of the N, W, S, and E in the street names showed that there was an ability to divide the city into compass directions. By doing this, the city can focus on cleansing large areas of crime and dangers that pedestrians may face.

### Roadmap Of Aspect Three
Include information about the accidents and more specifically pedestrian accidents in Chicago.
