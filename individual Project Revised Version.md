### Documentation
In this aspect you can see the correlation between the amount of red light violations and speeding violations in the city of Chicago. Due to the closely correlated aspects of each line and not focusing on the values these lines are comprised of, it is shown that speeding violations rise and fall with the amount of redlight violations captured by the cameras. I have included a forecast of future trends based off this data. Although there is a continuing decline in overall traffic violations, there is not a substantial decrease to show that people are driving to make themselves and others safer on the roadways.
