### Documentation
In this aspect you can see the correlation between the amount of red light violations and speeding violations in the city of Chicago. Due to the closely correlated aspects of each line and not focusing on the values these lines are comprised of, it is shown that speeding violations rise and fall with the amount of redlight violations captured by the cameras. I have included a forecast of future trends based off this data. Although there is a continuing decline in overall traffic violations, there is not a substantial decrease to show that people are driving to make themselves and others safer on the roadways. 

### Creation
To create this chart, place violaiton date in the columns and sort it by month/year. Next select number of records from each data source and make sure to rename them to differentiate the two options. In the show me tab select the dual lines graph to combine the two measures from the rows selection. Lastly, apply the forecast selection for only the speeders aspect as this graph is meant to project statistics for speeding violaations and the red light data should only attribute the data. To add the finishing touches get rid of the row headers as the values are not necessary to magnify the point the visualization is trying to get across.
